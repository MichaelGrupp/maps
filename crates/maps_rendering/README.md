# maps_rendering

Image rendering and texture management tailored to the [maps](https://crates.io/crates/maps) crate.

For fast image editing previews in egui, with arbitrary scale & pose, and potentially very large source images.

> ⚠️ While the `maps` app is stable, `maps_rendering` doesn't have a stable API yet.
> Parts of the library might change in upcoming minor versions, and are probably not much useful outside of `maps`.
