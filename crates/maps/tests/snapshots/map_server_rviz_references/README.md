Reference screenshots of RViz showing maps published by the `map_server` with different `mode` values in the YAML.

Saved here because the value interpretation of `map_server` contradicts what is written in the documentation.
This is a quirk that is unlikely to be fixed now, but worth to document here.
See also `maps::value_interpretation::Quirks`.
